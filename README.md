# Hospital_Data_Analysis_PowerBi_Project
•  Designed and Developed an Interactive Hospital Data Dashboard using Power BI, visualizing key patient metrics, departmental performance, and time-based trends.
•  Analyzed a dataset of 25M patients, tracking last month (709K) and past year last month (640K) patient counts, and provided insights into patient distribution by age profile and time bands.
•  Visualized departmental performance, highlighting high patient volumes in Orthopaedics (3.04M), ENT (2.8M), and Ophthalmology (2.01M).
• Created age-based patient distribution analysis, identifying the 16–64 age group as the largest patient segment (61.27%) and analyzing trends over different time bands
